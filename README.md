# CUDA MLP from Scratch

This project implements a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using CUDA C++. It's designed to learn and run fully on the GPU, including forward pass, loss computation, and backpropagation.

## Structure

- `include/`: Header files.
- `src/`: CUDA source files.
- `data/`: Optional input datasets.
- `build/`: Compiled output.

## Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA Toolkit (>= 11.0)
- g++ (for host compilation)
